--------------------------- script.10 ---------------------------

The main actions here are:
  a) transaction 0 locks file 0 in IS mode, and lock pages 0,1 
     of file 0 in S mode.
  b) transaction 1 locks file 0 in IS mode, and lock pages 1,2 
     of file 0 in S mode.



The detailed description of each command line is:

 open_trans(trans 0)
 lock_file(trans 0, file 0, mode IS, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 0, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 1, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)

 open_trans(trans 1)
 lock_file(trans 1, file 0, mode IS, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 1, file 0, page 1, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 1, file 0, page 2, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)

 look at state of file 0

 commit(trans 0)
 commit(trans 1)
 quit



The expected output (so as to perform a "diff" with the next 
execution output) is:

-------------------------------------------------
O 0
--> 1

L 0 0 1 c f
--> 0

l 0 0 0 3 c f
--> 0

l 0 0 1 3 c f
--> 0

O 1
--> 1

L 1 0 1 c f
--> 0

l 1 0 1 3 c f
--> 0

l 1 0 2 3 c f
--> 0

F 0
--> File 0 is owned by:
   . transaction 0 (lock IS)
   . transaction 1 (lock IS)
 And has the page(s):
   . page 2 (lock S)
   . page 1 (lock S)
   . page 0 (lock S)
