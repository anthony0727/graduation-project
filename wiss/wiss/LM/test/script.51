--------------------------- script.51 ---------------------------

The main actions here are:
  a) Tries to open a transaction twice, and to commit a not-opened
     transaction.




The detailed description of each command line is:

 open_trans(trans 0)
 open_trans(trans 0)
 commit_trans(trans 1)

 quit



The expected output (so as to perform a "diff" with the next 
execution output) is:

-------------------------------------------------
O 0
--> 1

O 0 -0-ERROR, The given trans id is a duplicate, transactions should be uniqu
e.

--> -1

C 1
ERROR, Transaction 1 is not active and can't be commited.
