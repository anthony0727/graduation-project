--------------------------- script.52 ---------------------------

The main actions here are:
  a) transaction 0 locks file 0 and page 0 in manual mode.
  b) transaction 1 locks file 0 in X mode, and transaction 0
     falls in wait by asking for a lock on file 1.
  c) transaction 0 which is supposed to sleep asks for lock_file,
     lock_page, release_file, release_page, commit.



The detailed description of each command line is:

 open_trans(trans 0)
 lock_file(trans 0, file 0, mode IS, duration MANUAL, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 0, mode S, duration MANUAL, cond False)

 open_trans(trans 1)
 lock_file(trans 1, file 1, mode X, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_file(trans 0, file 1, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 look at state of trans 0

 open_trans(trans 0)
 lock_file(trans 0, file 0, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 0, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 release_file(trans 0, file 0)
 release_page(trans 0, page 0)

 commit(trans 0)
 commit(trans 1)
 quit



The expected output (so as to perform a "diff" with the next 
execution output) is:

--> Trans 0 is owning:

   . Page 0 (lock S)
           . lock S granted to trans 0
   . File 0 (lock IS)
           . lock IS granted to trans 0
 And is waiting for:
   . File 1 (lock X)
           . lock X granted to trans 1
           . lock S waited by trans 0 - duration 2
