--------------------------- script.53 ---------------------------

The main actions here are:
  a) transaction 0 asks for a lock on a page, while the file 
     containing this page is unlocked.



The detailed description of each command line is:

 open_trans(trans 0)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 0, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 
 commit(trans 0)
 quit



The expected output (so as to perform a "diff" with the next 
execution output) is:

-------------------------------------------------
O 0
--> 1

l 0 0 0 3 c f
(lock_page) error: file not locked

--> -1950
