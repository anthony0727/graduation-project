test2 can be run in 2 manners: 
- interactively, if test2 is run without parameter
- in batch, to run predefined tests, if "test2 -f <script_file_name>" is run,
  where <script_file_name> is one of the script.xx described below.



Asking for locks scripts:
  script.10
    Locks files and pages in shared mode.

  script.11
    Upgrades locks on files and pages, and locks files and pages in 
    exclusive mode.

  script.12
    Ask for a lock on a page without having locked the file containing this
    page. This is for calls to lock_page() with file_id = nullFID on the 
    workstation.

Releasing locks scripts:
  script.20
    Releases file and page locks by committing the owner transaction.

  script.21
    Releases file and page locks by aborting the owner transaction.

  script.22
    Releases file and page locks in manual mode (= the non 2 phase locking 
    mode which is used for indices).

    Signals a file is destroyed.

Deadlock detection scripts:
  script.30
    Detects a deadlock between two transactions (locks on files only).

  script.31
    Detects a deadlock between three transactions (locks on files and pages).

Conditional locking script:
  script.40
    Locks files only if the lock can be granted immediatly. Otherwise, 
    if it would produce a wait or a deadlock, the requirement is forgotten.

Bad usages scripts:
  script.50
    The transaction must be opened before it asks for a lock on a file 
    or on a page, and before to release a file or a page.

  script.51
    A transaction cannot be opened or committed twice.

  script.52
    The transaction can't neither ask for a lock, nor release a file 
    or a page when it is waiting.

  script.53
    The file must be locked before to ask for a lock on a file's page.
