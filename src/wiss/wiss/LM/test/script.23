--------------------------- script.23 ---------------------------

The main actions here are:
  a) transaction 0 locks file 0 in IS mode, and lock pages 0,1,3
     of file 0 in S mode.
  b) transaction 0 upgrades its file lock to X, and transactions 
     1 and 2 ask for a lock on file 0.
  c) transaction 0 signals that the file 0 is destroyed to allow 
     the transactions 1 and 2 restart and abort (as the file was
     destroyed by transaction 0).



The detailed description of each command line is:

 open_trans(trans 0)
 open_trans(trans 1)
 open_trans(trans 2)

 lock_file(trans 0, file 0, mode IS, duration MANUAL, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 0, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 1, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 2, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)

 lock_file(trans 0, file 0, mode X, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_file(trans 1, file 0, mode IX, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_file(trans 2, file 0, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)

 look at state of transaction 0

 abort(trans 1)
 abort(trans 2)
 commit(trans 0)
 quit



The expected output (so as to perform a "diff" with the next 
execution output) is:

T 0
--> Trans 0 is owning:

   . Page 2 (lock S)
           . lock S granted to trans 0

   . Page 1 (lock S)
           . lock S granted to trans 0

   . Page 0 (lock S)
           . lock S granted to trans 0
   . File 0 (lock X)
           . lock X granted to trans 0
           . lock IX waited by trans 1 - duration 2
           . lock S waited by trans 2 - duration 2
 No lock waited by trans. 0
