--------------------------- script.50 ---------------------------

The main actions here are:
  a) Tries to lock a file and a page, to release a file and a page
     without having open the transaction.



The detailed description of each command line is:

 lock_file(trans 0, file 0, mode IS, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 0, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 release_file(trans 0, file 0)
 release_page(trans 0, page 0)

 quit



The expected output (so as to perform a "diff" with the next 
execution output) is:

-------------------------------------------------
L 0 0 1 c f
ERROR (proc lock_file), Transaction cell is null, non existant.

--> -750

l 0 0 0 3 c f
ERROR (proc lock_page), trans_cell passed in is NULL.

ERROR (proc lock_page), Activate trans before locking a page on it.

--> -1250

R 0 0 ERROR, Transaction is not active and can't be commited.

--> -750

r 0 0
ERROR, Transaction is not active and can't be commited.

--> -750
