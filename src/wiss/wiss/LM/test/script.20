--------------------------- script.20 ---------------------------

The main actions here are:
  a) transaction 0 locks file 0 in IS mode, and lock pages 0,1,3
     of file 0 in S mode.
  b) transaction 1 locks a page of file 0 in X mode, and waits for
     transaction 0 on the page.
  c) transaction 2 locks file 0 in X mode, and waits for
     transaction 0 on the file.
  d) transaction 0 commits, getting transaction 1 out of wait.
  e) transaction 1 commits, getting transaction 2 out of wait.



The detailed description of each command line is:

 open_trans(trans 0)
 lock_file(trans 0, file 0, mode IS, duration MANUAL, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 0, mode S, duration MANUAL, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 1, mode S, duration MANUAL, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 2, mode S, duration MANUAL, cond False)

 open_trans(trans 1)
 lock_file(trans 1, file 0, mode IX, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 1, file 0, page 1, mode X, duration COMMIT, cond False)

 open_trans(trans 2)
 lock_file(trans 2, file 0, mode X, duration COMMIT, cond False)

 look at state of transaction 0

 commit(trans 0)
 look at state of transaction 1

 commit(trans 1)
 look at state of transaction 2

 commit(trans 2)
 quit



The expected output (so as to perform a "diff" with the next 
execution output) is:

T 0
--> Trans 0 is owning:

   . Page 2 (lock S)
           . lock S granted to trans 0

   . Page 1 (lock S)
           . lock S granted to trans 0
           . lock X waited by trans 1 - duration 2

   . Page 0 (lock S)
           . lock S granted to trans 0
   . File 0 (lock IX)
           . lock IX granted to trans 1
           . lock IS granted to trans 0
           . lock X waited by trans 2 - duration 2
 No lock waited by trans. 0

C 0
-->(walkfile) transaction 1 can restart!

T 1
--> Trans 1 is owning:

   . Page 1 (lock X)
           . lock X granted to trans 1
   . File 0 (lock IX)
           . lock IX granted to trans 1
           . lock X waited by trans 2 - duration 2
 No lock waited by trans. 1

C 1
-->(walkfile) transaction 2 can restart!

T 2
--> Trans 2 is owning:
   . File 0 (lock X)
           . lock X granted to trans 2
 No lock waited by trans. 2
