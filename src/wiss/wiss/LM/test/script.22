--------------------------- script.22 ---------------------------

The main actions here are:
  a) transaction 0 locks file 0 in IS mode, and lock pages 0,1,3
     of file 0 in S mode.
  b) transaction 1 locks file 0 and 2 of its pages.
  c) transaction 0 releases page 2.
  d) transaction 0 releases file 0.



The detailed description of each command line is:

 open_trans(trans 0)
 lock_file(trans 0, file 0, mode IS, duration MANUAL, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 0, mode S, duration MANUAL, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 1, mode S, duration MANUAL, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 2, mode S, duration MANUAL, cond False)

 open_trans(trans 1)
 lock_file(trans 1, file 0, mode IX, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 1, file 0, page 1, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 1, file 0, page 2, mode X, duration COMMIT, cond False)

 look at state of transaction 0

 release_page(trans 0, page 2)
 look at state of transaction 0

 release_file(trans 0, file 0)
 look at state of transaction 0
 look at state of transaction 1

 commit(trans 0)
 commit(trans 1)
 quit



The expected output (so as to perform a "diff" with the next 
execution output) is:
