--------------------------- script.11 ---------------------------

The main actions here are:
  a) transaction 0 locks file 0 in IS mode, and lock pages 0,1 
     of file 0 in S mode.
  b) transaction 0 upgrades the lock of file 0 to IX mode, and the lock  
     of page 1 of file 0 to X mode.



The detailed description of each command line is:

 open_trans(trans 0)
 lock_file(trans 0, file 0, mode IS, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 0, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 1, mode S, duration COMMIT, cond False)

 look at state of file 0

 lock_file(trans 0, file 0, mode IX, duration COMMIT, cond False)
 lock_page(trans 0, file 0, page 1, mode X, duration COMMIT, cond False)

 look at state of file 0

 commit(trans 0)
 quit



The expected output (so as to perform a "diff" with the next 
execution output) is:

-------------------------------------------------
O 0
--> 1

L 0 0 1 c f
--> 0

l 0 0 0 3 c f
--> 0

l 0 0 1 3 c f
--> 0

F 0
--> File 0 is owned by:
   . transaction 0 (lock IS)
 And has the page(s):
   . page 1 (lock S)
   . page 0 (lock S)

L 0 0 2 c f
--> 0

l 0 0 1 5 c f
--> 0

F 0
--> File 0 is owned by:
   . transaction 0 (lock IX)
 And has the page(s):
   . page 1 (lock X)
   . page 0 (lock S)
