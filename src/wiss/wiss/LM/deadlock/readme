Dewitt, 11/91,  fixed bug in alloc_graph.c and create.c that was 
resulted from having the pidHashTbl and fidHashTbl associated
with each transaction in their private memory.  Basically this
was a good idea except for the fact that walkfile (which is
called when releasing a lock) turns out to end up to having to
manipulating a waiting transaction's pidHashTbl or fidHashTbl.
