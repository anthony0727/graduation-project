Level 3 software maintains an active scan  table  that  describes
all scans in progress. For each scan, the table contains the scan
type (sequential, index, link, or long), and the open file number
of  the  file  associated  with the scan.  For scans on long data
items a cursor is included in the scan table which is the current
byte of the scan.  For sequential, index, or link type scans, the
cursor stored in the scan table is the current RID of the scan.
